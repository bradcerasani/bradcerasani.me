I’ve been designing and implementing software for over a decade, with clients and collaborators that include Apple, Twitter, and the American Music Awards.

In 2014 I joined the design team at Black Pixel; a mobile-focused digital products agency whose software is used by over 100 million people daily. In 2016, I formally transitioned into the engineering group, where a new Web Services Team was created under my lead. In the years that followed, I grew this team from three to more than twenty highly-engaged developers across a wide variety of projects and technologies.

Black Pixel was acquired by Hypergiant in late 2018, where I am presently Director of Web Development.

Offline, I like [working with my hands](/projects/garage/), collecting twentieth-century [furniture](https://twitter.com/bradcerasani/status/1214300670901141504) and objects, and playing hockey, soccer, and [music](/projects/hoist).
