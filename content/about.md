I’ve been designing and implementing software for over a decade, with clients and collaborators that include Apple, Twitter, and the American Music Awards.

I like systems engineering and user-centric design, and believe there's always more than one way to do things.

In 2014 I joined the design team at Black Pixel; a mobile-focused digital products agency whose software is used by over 100 million people daily. In 2016, I formally transitioned into the engineering group, where a new Web Services Team was created under my lead. In the years that followed, I grew this team from three to more than twenty highly-engaged developers⁠—across a wide variety of projects, platforms, and technologies.

Black Pixel was acquired by Hypergiant in late 2018, where I am presently Director of Web Development.

Offline, I play hockey and soccer, collect twentieth-century [furniture](https://twitter.com/bradcerasani/status/1214300670901141504) and [objects](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEm_0otAZo1/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), and bury myself in <Link to="/#side-projects">side projects</Link> that follow themes of design, technology, and making things.
