title: Inflection point
description: The John Lennon Educational Tour Bus is an audio and video recording studio on wheels, dedicated to providing students with a hands-on opportunity to learn about digital production. In 2006 it was in town while on tour with the Black Eyed Peas, and I was selected to represent my school division (~15,000 students at the time) to spend a day on the bus.<br /><br />Together with 5 other students from my city, we wrote and recorded a song, shot a music video, and learned about post-production on the bus. We also got to hang out with will.i.am, who used the studio when it wasn't occupied by students.<br /><br />Looking back, I think of this as an inflection point in my life; it opened my eyes to what's possible with software, and began a lifelong affinity for Apple computers (who sponsor the bus) and the creative work they foster. I got my first Mac, recorded my band's first album, and made my first website the following year.
