I've been designing and implemeting software for over a decade, with clients that include Apple, Twitter, and the American Music Awards.

In 2014, I joined the design team at Black Pixel; a mobile-focused digital products agency whose software is used by over 100 million people daily. In 2016, I formally transitioned into the engineering group, where a new Web Services Team was created under my lead. In the years that followed, I grew this team from three to more than twenty highly-engaged developers across a wide variety of projects and technologies.

Black Pixel was acquired by Hypergiant in late 2018, where I am presently the Director of Web Development.

Offline, I like working with my hands, collecting twentieth-century furniture and objects, and playing hockey or soccer.
