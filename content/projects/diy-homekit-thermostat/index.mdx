In a recent basement renovation I added two heated floor zones: one for the laundry room, and another for a basement bathroom.

Most thermostats for heated floors are aesthetically foul, and that's a no for me.

[bad looking thermostats]

### Past approach

I've run into this same problem before, and solved it using a transformer relay and a Nest. The transformer relay supplies the Nest with 24V operating voltage, and closes the relay to activate the 240V floor loop when the thermostat calls for heat. This setup has been in use daily for nearly 5 years without issue, but it has a few major drawbacks:

1. It's hacky
2. It's expensive
3. Nest does not support external wired temperature sensors (such as the ones embedded in the actual floor), so temperature readings are ambient-only1.

In order to reliably activate the heated floors using ambient-only measurements, I schedule the floor Nest to 4Â° _above_ ambient level. So e.g. if the Nest controlling the main floor is set to 20Â° C, the Nest controlling the floors in the kitchen is set to 24Â° C. The concrete floors are unable to raise the ambient temperature more than a degree or two over several hours, so setting the thermostat to 24Â° C acts as a bonafide "on" switch. In my case the floors never get uncomfortably hot, but this may not be true in floors with a lower thermal mass (e.g. porcelain or ceramic tile). If used in a small enclosed space wherein the floors have a greater impact on ambient level, a greater temperature offset may be needed.

So yeah â€” hacky and expensive. We can do better.

### New approach

I've dabbled in home automation for more than a decade, and in that time I've come to value simplicity and reliability above all else. At first I thought I wanted as many sensors and data points as possible, but what I actually want is the highest possible signal/noise ratio.

With this in mind, I could establish some requirements for a new _minimally_ connected thermostat:

###### Want

1. To turn the floors on or off with presence- or schedule-based2 automations via Homekit

###### Don't want

1. To manage the temperature setpoint remotely
2. To know the temperature of the floors remotely
3. Anything on the wall

I find it useful to think about systems design in terms of inputs and outputs. When considering a thermostat in a standard heat-only sytem, the I/O might be:

###### Inputs

- 24V (Rh wire)
- Common (C wire)
- Temperature sensor (10-12k thermistor common for in-floor heat)
- Setpoint (user-configured; e.g. 30Â° C)

###### Outputs

- Turn on heat (24V on W wire or close relay)

So a thermostat monitors the temperature sensor,

- progressive enhancement

1. Most dedicated floor thermostats can be configured to use surface _or_ ambient temp.
2. e.g. Washing laundry, watching a movie, basement occupancy, etc.
