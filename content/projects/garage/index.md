<!-- In the summer of 2019, I designed and built a garage.

> How hard can it be...

I thought, having never before framed or built any structure of consequence.

More on the build soon...

<!-- The garage is clad in full-length vertical cedar planks, fastened to a rain screen I made with fluted coroplast. The rain screen allows ventilation on the back side of the cedar, and reduces surface contact by ~90%. This helps prevent moisture from becoming trapped between it and the building wrap, which should increase its life considerably.

A traditional soffit wasn't possible due to the lack of roof overhang, so on the sides, the top of the rain screen transitions to intake ventilation running perpendicular to the siding. Intake surface area is balanced to the ridge venting, and covered with coarse black mesh to prevent insects from entering.

For the garage door, I imported one-piece door hardware from California and designed an aluminum subframe that I sent to a local fabricator. I had to rent a 22' U-Haul to pick it up.

Every corner is mitred -->
