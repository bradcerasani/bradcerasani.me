<Note>

This post describes building a lightweight Markdown-powered blog engine in Ruby. Check out this (2013) iteration of my site in the archives [here](https://2013.bradcerasani.me).

</Note>

I've never been great at keeping a blog[^1]. Any space I've made for writing in the past has been as Shedbot, the moniker I've used for my photo/design work the past few years. I would always tread lightly posting on behalf a business, even my own. When speaking on behalf of a business you're always conscious of offending that exec who perhaps would've given you that big contract if he didn't see you talking about [ManBearPig](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf69EEL3WBk) that one time.

I've been wanting to write my own blogging app since seeing [this post](http://sam.roon.io/new-blog) by [Sam Soffes'](http://twitter.com/soffes) about one of his many blog iterations earlier this year. He wrote a Sinatra app that uses a GitHub repo of markdown files as posts and caches them in Redis. I really liked the idea of using static markdown files as a post archive; no messy databases or clunky web interface to get in the way of actually writing. I built something similar.

## The build

This was my first trial in server-side programming, so the build took a while. Though I had studied some Ruby previously, there's no substitute for diving in and getting your hands dirty. I found a handful of repos on Github that performed similar actions, so I cloned a handful locally and referenced them throughout the build. While Sam's blog was the original inspiration, his Redis integration was an added level of complexity that I wasn't ready for. Here's a quick overview of my my app, starting with a sample markdown file:

```yaml
# A-Dance-With-Sinatra.md

title: A Dance With Sinatra
excerpt: Adventures in programming with Ruby and Sinatra.
date: 2013-09-20
tags: general
--
Lorem ipsum dolor...
```

In the Rakefile, line 5 iterates through each of the .md files in the entries directory, and 6 splits off each post's metadata above `--`. The metadata is then ordered by reverse date and written to `_directory.yaml`.

```ruby
# Rakefile
namespace :journal do
  task :reload do
    a = []
    Dir["entries/*.md"].each do |file|
      entry = File.read(file).split("--\n")
      meta = Psych.load(entry[0])
      a.push({
        title: meta['title'],
        excerpt: meta['excerpt'],
        date: meta['date'],
        tags: meta['tags'],
        slug: "/journal/" << File.basename(file, ".md"),
      })
      puts "#{a.count} posts indexed."
    end
    File.open("views/journal/_directory.yaml", 'w') {
      |file| file.write a.sort_by{|a| a[:date]}.reverse.ya2yaml
    }
  end
end
```

Now, when the user requests a URL from /journal, Sinatra checks to see if the corresponding file exists in /entries. If so, it'll load up the entry's structure according to haml template `journal/entry.haml`, and parse the actual post content along with the metadata.

```ruby
# Application.rb
get "/journal/:entry/?" do
  file = "entries/#{params[:entry]}.md"
  if File.exist?(file)
    @entries = load_directory('journal')
    parse('/journal/entry', file)
  else
    404
  end
end

helpers do
	def parse(template, file)
  	entry = File.read(file).split("---\n")
	  @meta = Psych.load(entry[0])
  	@text = entry[1]
	  haml template.to_sym
	end
	def load_directory(dir)
	  Psych.load(File.open("views/#{dir}/_directory.yaml"))
	end
end
```

The markdown rendering is handled by [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) with [SmartyPants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) enabled for smart quotes and all that good stuff. [Pygments.rb](https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb) is used for code highlighting.

```ruby
# Application.rb
class BetterRender < Redcarpet::Render::HTML
  include Redcarpet::Render::SmartyPants
  def block_code(code, lang)
    if lang
      Pygments.highlight(code, lexer: lang.to_sym, options: {linespans: 'line'})
    else
      "<div class='highlight ki'><pre>#{code}</pre></div>"
    end
  end
end

def redcarpet(text)
	markdown = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(BetterRender, fenced_code_blocks: true)
	markdown.render(text)
end
```

## Design & typography

The sans-serif body type is [Whitney](http://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/overview/) and the headline slab [Sentinel](http://www.typography.com/fonts/sentinel/overview). Both typefaces are designed by HF&J and served by Cloud.typography. Typesetting follows the [modular scale](http://modularscale.com/scale/?px1=20&px2=&ra1=1.333&ra2=0).

I designed a custom pygments stylesheet to ensure code highlighting in the browser would precisely mimic my local environment in Sublime Text 3. The colour scheme is based on the [Tomorrow Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) theme by [Chris Kempson](https://twitter.com/chriskempson). The monospace font used in the code views is [Source Code Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html) by Adobe.

The accent colour, #3BA7BB is the colour of Cartman's hat from South Park.

## Hosting & deployment

The app is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and deployed via Git.

In order to begin a post as quickly as possible, I wrote a helper function for [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) that creates a markdown file with proper formatting and cd's into my app directory.

```bash
#	Blog Kickstart - Fish Shell
function blog # $title $tags
  set date (date '+%Y-%m-%d')
  set filename (echo $argv[1] | tr -s ' ' | tr ' ' '-')
  set gitdir ~/documents/Journal/
  set var_count (count $argv)
  cd $gitdir
    if test $var_count = 2
  		echo title: $argv[1]\nexcerpt: \ndate: $date\ntags: $argv[2]\n---\n\n >entries/$filename.md
    else
   		echo title: $argv[1]\nexcerpt: \ndate: $date\ntags: general\n---\n\n >entries/$filename.md
   	end
  open entries/$filename.md
end
```

## Closing

This has been a lot of fun to build, and I have a lot to do on it still. It's endearing releasing something before it's polished; I feel more inspired to continue work on it instead of feeling utterly and completely sick of it.
