In 1984 a 20 year-old philosophy student named [Rick Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin) and a 26 year-old hip-hop promoter named [Russell Simmons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Simmons) founded a record label called Def Jam Recordings[^1].

One of my favourite quotes comes from Simmons, whose mentality helped Def Jam become the most ubiquitous label in hip-hop history.

> Surround yourself with people who are smarter than you.

I recently came across [a post](http://blog.verneho.com/post/35460914051/invest-in-people-based-on-my-original-post) by [Verne Ho](https://twitter.com/verneho) about the importance of surrounding yourself with good people, and it reminded me of the Russell Simmons quote I’ve held closely for years. I loved Verne’s sketch notes on the subject, and they inspired my attempt to recreate them as on the web.

Check out what I came up with [here](http://bradcerasani.github.io/Invest-in-People/).

[^1]: Def Jam went on to pioneer the hip-hop revolution of the late 80’s, and today is home to artists like Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Rick Ross, and Rihanna.
