          <h2>This is a h2</h2>
          <p>
            Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having
            little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest
            me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the
            watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the
            spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself
            growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
            November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing
            before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral
            I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of
            me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from
            deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
            people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
            as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a
            philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly
            take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but
            knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish
            very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

          <h3>h3 looks like this</h3>
          <p>
            There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
            wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with
            her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its
            extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by
            waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of
            sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

          <h4>Hello world from h4</h4>
          <p>
            Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from
            Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,
            northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around
            the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in
            ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon
            the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China;
            some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better
            seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in
            lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to
            desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they
            here?
          </p>

          <blockquote>

            But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
            seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but
            the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of
            yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh
            the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they
            stand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and
            alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here
            they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of
            the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?

          <h5>Say you are in the country</h5>
          <p>
            Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.
            Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down
            in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is
            magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his
            deepest reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going,
            and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all
            that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American
            desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied
            with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation
            and water are wedded for ever.

            But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest,
            shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all
            the valley of the Saco.
